The way my heart beats when I'm thinking of you
I'm kinda lovesick, my fever's out of control
From a distance, could pick you out of the view
Don't say nothing, let's sit in silence a few
I feel you hands tighten around me
I let it happen, I'm surrounded
Intoxicated by you, I'm drunk off just a taste
Oh, I fade into you, I feel your influence (Ooh)
Something, something
Is in the air, I'm choking up, oh
In my lungs, lungs
My chest tightens, is it love, oh?
One look at you, I'm choking up
Need oxygen, give me some air, I think I'm
running out
Babe, babe, babe
How was the evening?
Was it a date, date, date?
Intentions clearing
Oh, fuck, I made her pay
My pockets were empty
And you stayed after to say
I like you, boy, fly out to me (Oh, god)
We looked for loose change to buy just one
little pack
Don't let the love fade, guess fighting's just
part of that
And life's what we make, so let's be stupid in
fact
Let's drink the day away, I wanna love you like
that
Something, something
Is in the air, I'm choking up, oh
In my lungs, lungs
My chest tightens, is it love, oh?
One look at you, I'm choking up
Need oxygen, give me some air, I think I'm
running out
I need some oxygen
I'm in the stratosphere, a long way down (Oh)
I picked out your face out of the crowd
If love is in the air, need oxygen, oh-oh-oh
